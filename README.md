# To-Do-Flutter
A simple To-Do app built on Flutter

This Flutter application is designed to manage tasks efficiently using three major folders that play key roles in building the user interface:

Folder Structure

model:
The model folder is responsible for defining the structure of the to-do items.

screens:
Screens are responsible for rendering the user interface of different parts of the app, such as the task list and add task screens.

widgets:
Widgets are reusable components that encapsulate UI elements and behavior, making it easier to build and maintain the app's interface.
